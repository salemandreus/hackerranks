Hackerrank exercise answers - my examples/practise for maximising a TDD workflow effectively

###Exercises:

#####python-default-dict - using default dict to efficiently find where words from a list appear in another list, output exact indices of occurrence, one line of indices per word, output -1 if no occurrence for that word

#####python-lists 
uses a generator and tracks unimplemented cases in test output.
Generators: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/generator#create

#####sock-merchant
uses a Counter

Check commit history on this file for showing how I started with this exercise and gradually made it more effient, stepping up to default dict and then counters.
Also added pep 8 formatting.
A good example of TDD workflow for testing/efficiency.


###WIP
python-named-tuples
python-numpy
